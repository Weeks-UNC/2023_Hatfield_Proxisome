RNA as a proxisome figures
--------------------------

This repository contains the processed data and Jupyter notebooks used in the
analysis of DMS-MaP data and creation of figures for the "RNA as a Proxisome"
manuscript.

There are two options to view these notebooks:

1. Static web pages: These are view-only versions of the notebooks.

- [Full analysis and all figures](./full-analysis.html)
- [Combining base-pairing bonuses](./combining-bp-bonuses.html)
- [Combining PAIRs](./combining-pairmap.html)

2. Interactive notebooks on your local machine

Download this repository. In order to view the Jupyter notebooks, you will need
Jupyter installed. In order to run them, you will need a Jupyter kernel with
RNAvigate installed.

In future versions of RNAvigate, syntax changes may prevent these notebooks
from running properly. If that is the case, here is the hard link to the
version of RNAvigate used in these notebooks.
